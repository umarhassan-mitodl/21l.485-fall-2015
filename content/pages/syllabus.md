Literature Faculty Policy on Plagiarism
---------------------------------------

The Literature Section has formulated this statement and policy for all plagiarism cases:

Plagiarism—the use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement—is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted and in all oral presentations, including images or texts in other media and for materials collected online. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available in the {{% resource_link "aad1509d-681c-47e9-83ff-e8c749a34a99" "Writing and Communication Center" %}}, review their {{% resource_link "fe2ad72c-7ee6-4683-886b-e98c4f214669" "Link" %}}, and review {{% resource_link "3dbf36dd-663b-4ef1-aaf5-8c6f73aaf4be" "MIT's online Academic Integrity Handbook" %}}.
